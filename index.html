                <p>This quiz will test you in ways no other quiz will. Your knowledge, willpower and perceverance will
                    be tested, you may even lose your soul. Minimum level 25 recommended for this quiz. And just like
                    all premium first-day release games; there are a lot of bugs, there's even a way to cheat and win
                    every single time but I won't patch it until after release because deadlines, but I will charge you
                    $100 for the license to play it. Have fun! </p>
                <p><strong>Game Rules: </strong> There are 5 questions. If you get a question wrong, you will lose 20
                    seconds from the timer. There is 60 seconds to complete the quiz. Sign your initials at the end and
                    submit your score!</p>
