## Introduction

This is the Week 4 challenge of the edX/Monash Bootcamp.  The challenge was to create a quiz based on the Acceptance Criteria as follows:

`GIVEN I am taking a code quiz<br>
WHEN I click the start button<br>
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question<br>
WHEN I answer a question<br>
THEN I am presented with another question<br>
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly<br>
THEN time is subtracted from the clock<br>
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0<br>
THEN the game is over<br>
WHEN the game is over<br>
THEN I can save my initials and score`

## Developer Comments
With this challenge I got a lot more experience using the localStorage API, used to store the user's initials and score. Also, the window API which is used to move from question to question in my application.  This project has many more lines of JavaScript code than my previous projects, and I'm beginning to see the importance of organising things a little better.  I think I could have done better at organising my code, and I'll be making note of this for the future challenges.  Often I would go to test something and I'd be rushing and wouldn't refactor my code... I would get side tracked and start the next feature.  I need to make it a habit to refactor my code after each feature and I'll be incorporating this process by making a commit dedicated to refactoring in the next challenge!
